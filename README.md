# Blog_Server_GraphQL_API

### Project that I did due to a Udemy Course that I took. The name of the course "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)".

Technologies that we used:
1. nodeJS - Backend
2. expressJS - Nodejs framework
3. graphql api 
4. mongoose - Object Data Modeling for mongoDB
5. validator

Important features from NodeJS and other used libraries:
1. Using GraphQL Queries 
2. Using GraphQL schema and resolvers

* Using the server with Blog app which was build with ReactJS (the frontend was not added to github)
